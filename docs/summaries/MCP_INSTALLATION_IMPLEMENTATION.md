- **Automated GitHub releases** with installation instructions
- **Docker image publishing** to GitHub Container Registry
- **Documentation updates** with version-specific installation commands
- **Checksum generation** for security verification

**Release Process**:

1. Triggered on Git tags (`v*`)
2. Builds binaries for all supported platforms
3. Creates GitHub release with installation instructions
4. Builds and publishes Docker images
5. Updates documentation with new version links

### 4. Installation Script (`scripts/install.sh`)

**Purpose**: One-command installation script for easy deployment.

**Key Features**:

- **Multiple installation methods**: binary, Go, Docker
- **Platform detection**: Automatic OS and architecture detection
- **User vs system installation**: Support for both installation scopes
- **Version selection**: Install latest or specific versions
- **MCP configuration generation**: Automatic client configuration output
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Clear error messages and troubleshooting

**Usage Examples**:

```bash
# Quick install (latest binary, system-wide)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LANIXX-HH/runfromyaml/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# User installation
./scripts/install.sh --user

# Go installation
./scripts/install.sh --method go

# Docker installation
./scripts/install.sh --method docker

# Specific version
./scripts/install.sh --version v1.0.0
```

### 5. Updated README.md

**Purpose**: Main project documentation with MCP installation section.

**Key Additions**:

- Dedicated MCP Server Installation section
- Quick installation commands
- MCP client configuration examples
- Links to comprehensive installation guide

## Installation Patterns Implemented

### Pattern 1: AWS-Style uvx Installation (Adapted for Go)

While AWS MCP servers use Python's `uvx` for installation, we've adapted this pattern for Go:

**AWS Pattern**:

```bash
uvx awslabs.terraform-mcp-server@latest
```

**Our Go Adaptation**:

```bash
go install github.com/lanixx/runfromyaml@latest
```

### Pattern 2: Direct Binary Installation

**Implementation**:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/LANIXX-HH/runfromyaml/releases/latest/download/runfromyaml-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/runfromyaml
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/runfromyaml
```

### Pattern 3: Docker-based Installation

**Implementation**:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/lanixx-hh/runfromyaml:latest
```

### Pattern 4: One-Click IDE Installation

**Cursor IDE Integration**:

- One-click install button with pre-configured settings
- Base64-encoded configuration for seamless setup
- Direct integration with Cursor's MCP installation system

## MCP Client Configuration

### Standard Configuration Format

All MCP clients use a consistent configuration format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "runfromyaml-workflow-server": {
      "command": "runfromyaml",
      "args": ["--no-file", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Client-Specific Configurations

1. **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
2. **VS Code**: MCP extension settings
3. **Amazon Q Developer**: `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json`
4. **Generic MCP clients**: Standard JSON configuration

## Security Considerations

### Binary Distribution Security

- **Checksums**: SHA256 checksums for all released binaries
- **Signed releases**: GitHub-signed releases for authenticity
- **HTTPS downloads**: All downloads use HTTPS

### Container Security

- **Non-root execution**: Container runs as non-root user
- **Minimal base image**: Alpine Linux for reduced attack surface
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

### MCP Server Security

- **Sandboxed execution**: MCP server runs in controlled environment
- **Input validation**: All tool inputs are validated
- **Resource isolation**: Proper resource access controls

## Distribution Channels

### 1. GitHub Releases

- **Primary distribution method**
- Multi-platform binaries with checksums
- Automated release notes with installation instructions

### 2. GitHub Container Registry

- **Docker image distribution**
- Multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64)
- Automated builds and publishing

### 3. Go Module Registry
