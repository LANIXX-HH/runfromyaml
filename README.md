## What is the goal of the project?

Actually it's a playground and an attempt to write a tool with which I can both create documentation of the steps automatically, record all the necessary configurations and all the necessary commands that must be executed to achieve the goal.

–úy main goal of this project is to write a utility with which it would be convenient and easy to collect documentation, configuration files and the commands themselves under one roof in the right sequence. basically, the way you try to achieve your goal. this is the most efficient way for this task and i have not found a sensible utility that does this.

## Why didn't I go with ansible?

Very heavyweight for such a task in my opinion. I have met people who saw everything in ansible and then only they understand how it works. very quickly the focus is lost - to write down the steps you just did quite simply and quickly and preferably document what is going on here in general.

My goal was to rewrite an existing bash tool in go. An essential part was a collection of all commands that need to be executed both inside the Docker container and outside the container to build the project. At the time, ansible was too complicated for that. This project is only one part, which only reads the commands from YAML and can execute them both outside and inside the container. Also conceivable are commands via SSH (Todo).

## Current state of Project

At the moment I am testing this on my android phone, on my windows machine, on my MacAir M2 and on my linux server and it is working pretty well so far.

### New Features (v0.0.1+)

- **ü§ñ MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI assistants to generate and execute workflows through natural language
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration for command generation and assistance
- **Interactive Shell Mode**: Record commands interactively and generate YAML automatically
- **Enhanced Configuration**: YAML-based configuration support with options block
- **Improved REST API**: Better authentication and output handling

### Empty Values and Command Blocks

runfromyaml now supports empty `values` blocks and empty command blocks, which are useful for:

- **Documentation**: Creating placeholder commands that document future implementations
- **Conditional Execution**: Commands that may be conditionally populated
- **Template Creation**: YAML templates with placeholder blocks
- **Development Workflow**: Incremental development where commands are added over time

#### Examples

Empty values block:

```yaml
cmd:
  - type: exec
    name: "future-setup"
    desc: "Setup commands will be added here"
    values: []
```

Completely empty command block:

```yaml
cmd:
  - type: shell
    name: "deployment-placeholder"
    desc: "Deployment commands to be implemented"
    values:
```

When empty command blocks are encountered, runfromyaml will skip execution with an informative message and continue processing the next commands.

### Examples

- Parse YAML file locally

~~~bash
runfromyaml --file my-commands.yaml
~~~

- Interactive Shell Mode (NEW)

~~~bash
runfromyaml --shell
~~~

This mode allows you to interactively record commands and automatically generate YAML structure from your input.

- AI Integration Mode (NEW)

~~~bash
# Set OpenAI API key and interact with AI
runfromyaml --ai --ai-key "your-api-key" --ai-in "create a docker command to list containers"

# Use different AI model
runfromyaml --ai --ai-key "your-api-key" --ai-model "gpt-4" --ai-cmdtype "bash" --ai-in "show disk usage"
~~~

- **ü§ñ MCP Server Mode (NEW)**

~~~bash
# Start MCP server with stdio transport (default for MCP)
runfromyaml --mcp

# Start MCP server with TCP transport and debug
runfromyaml --mcp --port 8080 --host localhost --debug

# Custom MCP server configuration
runfromyaml --mcp --mcp-name "my-workflow-server" --mcp-version "2.0.0"
~~~

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants to generate and execute workflows through natural language descriptions. It provides:

**üõ†Ô∏è Six Powerful Tools for AI Assistants:**

- `generate_and_execute_workflow` - Generate and execute workflows from natural language
- `generate_workflow` - Generate workflow YAML without execution  
- `execute_existing_workflow` - Execute pre-written YAML workflows
- `validate_workflow` - Validate workflow syntax and structure
- `explain_workflow` - Explain what workflows will do before execution
- `workflow_from_template` - Generate workflows from predefined templates

**üìö Rich Resource Library:**

- `workflow://templates` - Available workflow templates with parameters
- `workflow://examples` - Example workflows demonstrating features
- `workflow://schema` - JSON schema for workflow validation
- `workflow://best-practices` - Comprehensive best practices guide

**üß† Intelligent Workflow Generation:**
The server analyzes natural language and automatically generates appropriate blocks for Docker operations, database setup, web applications, SSH operations, and configuration management.

**üìñ For complete MCP documentation, examples, and integration guides, see: [docs/MCP_SERVER.md](docs/MCP_SERVER.md)**

- REST API Mode

~~~bash
runfromyaml --rest
~~~

- REST API Mode without Authentication ( !!! CAUTION: Do not use it in public networks !!! )

~~~bash
runfromyaml --rest --no-auth
~~~

- REST API Mode with redirected output to http response

~~~bash
runfromyaml --rest --restout
~~~

- Example CURL Call for REST API Mode

~~~bash
PASS=<rest_api_generated_password>
CURLOPT_TIMEOUT=30 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-yaml" -u rest:$PASS --data-binary @examples/windows.yaml http://192.168.0.100:8000/
~~~

## Syntax

### Options Block (NEW)

You can now define global options directly in your YAML file:

~~~yaml
options:
  - key: "rest"
    value: false
  - key: "no-auth"
    value: true
  - key: "host"
    value: "0.0.0.0"
  - key: "port"
    value: 8000
  - key: "ai"
    value: true
  - key: "ai-key"
    value: "sk-..."
  - key: "ai-model"
    value: "gpt-4"
  - key: "shell"
    value: false
~~~

### Logging Settings

all the logging setting should be defined as following example:

~~~yaml
logging:
  - output: stdout
  - level: info
~~~

- `level` - the following levels are possible: info, warn, debug, error, trace, fatal, panic
- `output` - define how the output should happen
  - NIL (nothing was set. missing output option) - it nothing is defined, no output will be created :)
  - `stdout` - should be default output
  - `file` - all the output will be redirected to json logfile (implemented with logrus module) in the current temp directory. by start of this program the logging json file will be shown.
  - `rest` - this payload should be delivered only via http post request as YAML. by default, if the programm is running in rest api mode, output will be overwritten to `rest`

### Environment Variables

all the environment variables should be defined as following example:

~~~yaml
env:
  - key: FOO
    value: bar
    ...
~~~

### CMD Blocks

all the commands & configurations should be written as following example:

~~~yaml
cmd:
  - type: conf
    confdest: $HOME/.aws/config
    confperm: 0644
    confdata: |
      [default]
      region = eu-central-1
      sso_start_url = https://mycompany.awsapps.com/start#/
      sso_region = eu-central-1
      sso_account_id = 123456789000
      sso_role_name = MyPowerRole
  - type: exec
    expandenv: true
    name: first
    desc: first command
    values:
      - /bin/cat $HOME/.aws/config
  - type: shell
    name: aws
    desc: show s3 buckets
    values:
      - aws sso login;
      - aws s3 ls
~~~

every section should begin with `-`

#### CMD Syntax

- `type` - this section describes the type of the current section. possible values:
  - `exec` - executes all commands described in the Values section.
  - `conf` - creates a configuration file with permissions under a specified path. required values are:
    - `confdest` - destination path for this configuration.
    - `confperm` - permissions (in Unix format. e.g.: `0644`) to save this file
    - `confdata` - contained data for the current configuration block
  - `shell` - this section defines a set of commands to be executed in a bash session
  - `docker` - this section defines a set of commands to be executed in a started and/or running container. required values for this section are:
    - `container` - name of the running container where all commands should be executed.
    - `command` - this section contains 2 different options how the proposed command should be executed. required values:
      - `run` - start all commands in the new container
      - `exec` - execute the command in the currently running container
    - `values` - this section defines all the commands to be executed in a started or running container
  - `docker-compose` - this section describes all things that should be executed with docker-compose. why do we need this? experience has shown that it is easier for developers to write a yaml file and specify the necessary options in a similar order than to remember the order of commands to execute. :) you can skip settings (global and command) with empty map like `[]` and set empty service name with `""`. to run a command inside of container, you should define values. for multiple command just separate it with semicolon (`;`)
  The required values for this section are:
    - `dcoptions` - global docker-compose options like path directory or docker-compose file(s).
    - `command` - docker-compose command like `run`, `up` or `down`.
    - `cmdoptions` - options needed for the selected command like `-i` or/and `-t`.
    - `service` - name of the service defined in the docker-compose yaml file
    - `values` - commands to be executed within the selected service (when starting the container or in the currently running container)
  - `ssh` - in this section you can run a remote command on specified host via SSH Connection
    - `user` - username for SSH Connection
    - `host` - hostname for SSH Connection
    - `port` - ssh port for SSH Connection
    - `options` - additional options for SSH Connection like `-i <path/to/ssh/public_key>`
    - `values` - set of commands separated by semicolon (`;`) which should be executed on remote host via SSH Connection
- `name` - this is the name of the section
- `desc` - long description of this section. should contain the really necessary information, what happens in this section.
- `values` - this section generally contains all the steps that should be executed to implement the described workflow. Multiple commands should be separated by `;`.
- `expandenv` - this is an optional switch setting used to enable or disable the environment variable resolution in the corresponding block. default value is disabled

## Examples

### Set logging options

- logging - with this you can set how the output should happen and with which log level that should take place

~~~yaml
logging:
  - level: info
  - output: stdout
~~~

### Define environment variables

- env - in this block variables are set, the other blocks both in the data area and in the setting in the respective block, such as path.

~~~yaml
env:
  - key: LC_ALL
    value: POSIX
  - key: PATH
    value: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin
~~~
  
### Create configuration file

- confdata - here the content of the configuration file is written in.

~~~yaml
--
cmd:
  - type: "conf"
    confdata: |

        test
          test
      test
    confdest: /etc/myconfig.conf
    confperm: 0644
~~~

### Call a OS Command with EXEC

- exec - with this you can start an OS system call with exec

~~~yaml
  - type: "exec"
    expandenv: true
    name: "envprint"
    desc: "show the output of %COMSPEC% variable on windows system"
    values:
      - cmd
      - /C
      - echo %COMSPEC%
~~~

### Call a Shell Command

- shell - This gives the possibility to call a command that is wrapped in bash. for example: `bash -c 'ls -lisa'`
  
~~~yaml
  - type: "shell"
    expandenv: true
    name: "list"
    desc: "list all files in current directory"
    values:
      - ls -lisa
~~~

### Run a Command via SSH connection on remote server
  
- ssh - in this section you can define a block with username, hostname, port and additional options to run a command set remotely via this SSH Connection

~~~yaml
  - type: "ssh"
    expandenv: true
    name: "ssh-run"
    desc: "run ls command via ssh connection"
    user: $USER
    host: localhost
    port: 22
    options:
      - -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa-localhost
    values:
      - uname
      - -a ;
      - pwd
~~~

### Docker-Compose Block

- docker-compose - Here you have the possibility to compose a complete docker-compose command as a YAML structure with global docker-compose options and specific command options and optionally execute there specific collection of commands separated by semicolon.

~~~yaml
  - type: "docker-compose"
    expandenv: true
    name: "build"
    desc: "build tooling"
    dcoptions:
      - -f $HOME/.tmp/tooling/docker-compose.yaml
      - --project-directory $HOME/.tmp/tooling
    cmdoptions: []
    command: build
    service: ""
    values: []
  - type: "docker-compose"
    expandenv: true
    name: "run"
    desc: "run tooling"
    dcoptions:
      - -f $HOME/.tmp/tooling/docker-compose.yaml
      - --project-directory $HOME/.tmp/tooling
    command: run
    service: tooling
    cmdoptions: []
    values:
      - zsh
~~~
  
### Call a Command inside a running Docker container or run it once

- docker - this section can be used to start some command or set of multiple command separated by semicolon in a running container or by starting new container and terminate it after run.

attention: you can use only `run` or `exec` command

~~~yaml
  - type: docker
    expandenv: true
    desc: "run command from docker container"
    name: "docker-run"
    command: run
    container: alpine
    values:
        - uname
        - -a;
        - pwd
~~~
